When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I am working on a remote computer or someone else is working with me on the project, then having a remote repository is helpful to share updates

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If someone has shared something on the remote repository, I may want to review before pulling it to Git, so manual option is better.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clone is to a create a copy of the repository on a local machine either from local machine or a remote. Fork helps you create a clone on github direclty without creating a local copy. Branch helps us to create multiple tracks from a master to try new features or have different versions like language based.
