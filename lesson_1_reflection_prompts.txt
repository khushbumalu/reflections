How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was much quicker and easier

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If I have made some changes to the program, which do not work as I intended, I can always use version control to see one of the previous versions and resume from there

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    At times, if you forget to create a commit, you may lose work if there is no automatic version saving function.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    If the files are interconnected, then it makes sense to save multiple files in one commit

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log helps to see the history of the file and git diff can help in understanding what changes have been doing between two versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    with git checkout, I can go to a previous commit, so even if I try something which doesn't work, I can go back to the previous commit

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    writing programs with advanced functionality
